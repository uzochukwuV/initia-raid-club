# Phantasma Sportsbook

Phantasma is an onchain sportsbook and prediction market built as a Move appchain on Initia. Users place 1X2 bets (Home/Draw/Away) against a shared House Pool, and LPs can provide liquidity to become the counterparty to every bet.

## Project Overview

Phantasma is built as a dedicated Initia Move appchain featuring:
- 1X2 sports betting markets with dynamic odds
- Multi-leg parlay support for higher payouts
- ERC4626-style LP share system with withdrawal queues
- ED25519 signature verification for secure bet settlement
- Auto-signing for fast bet placement and LP operations
- Real-time exposure tracking to prevent house insolvency

## Implementation Detail

- Move smart contract for bet placement, settlement, and LP management (quadratic_market::sportsbook)
- Type-safe frontend with Zustand state management and mock/mainnet toggle
- Uses `@initia/interwovenkit-react` for wallet and auto-signing
- Built to showcase onchain betting UX: wallet connection, rapid bet placement, and LP management in one flow

## Key Features

- **Dashboard**: View live markets, balance, win rate, and LP position
- **Bet Placement**: Build single or multi-leg parlays with automatic odds calculations
- **Liquidity Management**: Provide liquidity, track LP value, and request withdrawals
- **Leaderboard**: Compete on total volume, win rate, profit/loss, and LP returns
- **Activity Log**: Real-time feed of all betting and LP operations

## How to Run Locally

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:3000`.
4. For the default demo path, use mock mode. For live appchain mode, fill the required `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values from [`.env.example`](.env.example).

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for all required configuration. Key variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROLLUP_CHAIN_ID`: Phantasma appchain ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PHANTASMA_CONTRACT`: Deployed sportsbook contract address
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROLLUP_RPC_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROLLUP_REST_URL`, etc.: Chain endpoints

### Smart Contract

- Source: Phantasma sportsbook Move module (quadratic_market::sportsbook)
- Reference: [github.com/Naabiae/Betbing3](https://github.com/Naabiae/Betbing3)
- Module path: `quadratic_market::sportsbook`
- Key types: `BetSlip`, `Market`, `Selection`, `HousePool`, `LPState`
- Contract scope: player registration, ticket purchase, raid session start, action execution, settlement, and progression updates.

The submitted demo is built around one loop:

1. connect wallet
2. claim a username
3. bridge in assets
4. mint a raid ticket
5. run a short raid with 3-5 rapid actions
6. settle loot and update the leaderboard

This is the core submission claim:

> Initia Raid Club is the clearest demo of Initia-native gaming UX: identity, bridge, auto-signing, and fast onchain action in one loop.

The repo contains both:

- a `Next.js` frontend
- a real MiniEVM contract project for onchain raid state

When the required `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars are present, the app runs as a live rollup client with InterwovenKit, bridge modal flow, and `MsgCall` transactions.

## Why Initia

This project is built around the UX patterns Initia highlights for the hackathon:

- `auto-signing` for rapid, repeated gameplay actions
- `initia-usernames` for player identity and social surfaces
- `interwoven-bridge` for in-app onboarding without bouncing users into a separate flow

The goal is to show why a dedicated appchain and native transaction UX matter for a consumer game, not just for backend infrastructure.

## Included in This Repo

Implemented:
- `Next.js` App Router frontend
- mock mode for local product iteration
- mainnet-ready MiniEVM mode behind env configuration
- InterwovenKit provider wiring for custom rollup use
- real `MsgCall` transaction flow for `register`, `buyTickets`, `startRaid`, and `performAction`
- autosign controls for repeated combat actions
- in-app bridge modal entrypoint
- MiniEVM contract with Foundry tests
- hackathon submission scaffolding

## Stack

- `Next.js 15`
- `React 19`
- `TypeScript`
- `Tailwind CSS`
- `Zustand`

## Project Structure

- `app/` - route shell and global styles
- `components/` - shared UI components and the top-level app shell
- `features/` - domain panels for raid, profile, inventory, and leaderboard
- `lib/game/` - mock data, types, state, and raid resolution
- `lib/initia/` - live rollup config, contract ABI, MsgCall helpers, and mainnet runtime hook
- `contracts/raidclub-evm/` - MiniEVM contract, tests, and deploy script
- `docs/` - demo-facing docs
- `.initia/` - submission manifest template

## Mainnet Configuration

Fill the values in [`.env.example`](.env.example) and provide:

- rollup chain ID
- rollup EVM chain ID
- RPC / REST / JSON-RPC / indexer endpoints
- native denom and symbol
- deployed `RaidClub` contract address

Use these sources, in this order:

- `weave rollup launch`: prints the rollup endpoints immediately after launch
- published registry `chain.json`: chain ID, EVM chain ID, RPC / REST / JSON-RPC / indexer, explorer
- published registry `assetlist.json`: native denom / symbol / decimals
- `deploy_mainnet.sh` output: deployed `RaidClub` contract address

Confirmed public L1 defaults:

- Initia mainnet chain ID: `interwoven-1`
- Initia native base denom: `uinit`
- Initia display symbol: `INIT`

Important for MiniEVM rollups:

- if your rollup uses INIT as gas, the rollup-native denom is usually an `evm/<token-address>` base denom on the rollup assetlist, not plain `uinit`
- public MiniEVM mainnet examples in the official registry expose 18-decimal `INIT` assets and publish `json-rpc` / `indexer` endpoints in `chain.json`

Without those env vars the app stays in mock mode.

### Generate `.env.local` Automatically

After your rollup is launched and the contract is deployed, generate a ready-to-use runtime config from the published registry files:

```bash
npm run mainnet:generate-config -- \
  --chain-json ./chain.json \
  --assetlist ./assetlist.json \
  --contract-address 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
```

This writes `.env.local` and updates [`.initia/submission.json`](.initia/submission.json) with:

- rollup chain ID
- rollup EVM chain ID
- RPC / REST / JSON-RPC / indexer
- native gas denom / symbol / decimals
- deployed `RaidClub` address

The script also accepts published URLs directly:

```bash
npm run mainnet:generate-config -- \
  --chain-json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/initia-labs/initia-registry/main/mainnets/<your-rollup>/chain.json \
  --assetlist https://raw.githubusercontent.com/initia-labs/initia-registry/main/mainnets/<your-rollup>/assetlist.json \
  --contract-address 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
```

## Contract Workflow

Build and test the MiniEVM contract:

```bash
npm run contracts:build
npm run contracts:test
```

Deploy from [`contracts/raidclub-evm/script/deploy_mainnet.sh`](contracts/raidclub-evm/script/deploy_mainnet.sh) after setting:

- `MAINNET_RPC_URL`
- `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `TREASURY_ADDRESS`

## Demo Flow

The intended judge path is:

1. claim a username
2. bridge in INIT
3. mint a ticket
4. enter a raid
5. execute several auto-signed actions
6. show the result, loot, and leaderboard update

See [`docs/demo-script.md`](docs/demo-script.md) for the short presentation flow.

## Architecture Notes

The UI is intentionally separated from chain calls:

- `lib/game/store.ts` and `lib/game/engine.ts` keep the mock fallback mode fast
- `lib/initia/use-raid-club-mainnet.ts` owns live wallet, autosign, bridge, and contract sync
- `lib/initia/client.ts` builds live `MsgCall` transactions for the rollup contract
- `contracts/raidclub-evm/src/RaidClub.sol` owns the actual game state machine

That split keeps the frontend usable for fast iteration while still supporting a real onchain deployment path.

## Native Feature Plan

### Primary
Use `auto-signing` for repeated `MsgCall` combat actions on the MiniEVM rollup.

### Secondary
Use the bridge modal for in-app onboarding.

### Stretch
Replace the current wallet-open username path with an explicit in-app `initia-usernames` binding flow.

## Submission Checklist

- `README.md`
- `SPEC.md`
- `.env.example`
- `.initia/submission.json`
- `docs/demo-script.md`

## Notes

The build succeeds, contract tests pass, and the app runs in either mock mode or env-configured onchain mode.
